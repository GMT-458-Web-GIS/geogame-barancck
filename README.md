# Guess The Country
* This is my web application made with react to practice react, html, js and css
* Since this is an react project, and index.html is just a template, if you double click the index.html, you will see an empty page.
* When you start to play, game gives you hints step by step. In each mistake you get one more hint like the turkish TV show 'Çarkıfelek'
* Game does not consist a map or geo feature right now but I am planning to add some map in the following weeks.
